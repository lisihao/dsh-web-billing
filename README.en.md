A RMB/USD token-billing plugin for the DeepSeek Harness web UI (`dsh web`).
Bills every LLM call automatically against the **official DeepSeek pricing
policy schedule** (including the peak/off-peak pricing effective 2026-08-17),
persists a ledger, shows the **account balance**, and renders live cost badges
in the browser — **displaying USD when the UI language is English**.

> Token and cost figures are a **local DSH ledger**: only completed
> `assistant/message` events captured in this `$DSH_HOME` after the plugin was
> installed. They are not the official DeepSeek account invoice. The balance
> comes from `/user/balance`; reconcile usage across API keys and applications
> with the DeepSeek console Usage export.

| Mixed session (cloud + local) | Local-only session | Cloud-only session |
| --- | --- | --- |

- **Host side**: subscribes to `session/event` and prices each `assistant/message`
  that carries usage, using the message's own timestamp (policy + peak/off-peak
  phase at that moment). Ledger: `$DSH_HOME/storages/web-billing.json`.
  Also queries the official `GET /user/balance` with the provider's API key
  (60s refresh, silent degradation) and reports it with the billing state.
  **Self-hosted savings**: with `localProviders` configured, local model calls
  are valued at the official rate ("nominal value") while the actual cost is
  `localCostPerM` (default 0 = free); the difference is tracked as savings and
  shown in the UI (local messages show a "saved" chip).
- **Browser side**: the sidebar always shows the local DSH cost total, even when
  the current session has no ledger row, without competing with composer controls; each assistant
  message also gets a cost chip (hover shows token breakdown and model). The
  badge opens an expandable panel (session / today / month / total / **account balance** /
  **savings** / per-model, plus the active pricing mode). A DSH Desktop Frontend
  can merge its MacBook history baseline with every configured Server ledger.
  The panel preserves the local history, each reachable Server total, and any
  temporarily unavailable source instead of presenting the aggregate as one Server.
- **Read-only endpoints** (loopback by default): `GET /billing/state`,
  `GET /billing/session/<id>`.

## Pricing engine

`lib/pricing.js` ships a curated official policy schedule
(`OFFICIAL_PRICING_POLICIES`):

| Effective (Beijing) | Policy | Model prices (¥/1M; cache-hit / cache-miss / output) |
|---|---|---|
| 2025-02-09 | deepseek-chat / deepseek-reasoner standard | 0.5/2/8 · 1/4/16 |
| 2026-05-22 | V4 series 75% cut made permanent | v4-flash 0.02/1/2 · v4-pro 0.025/3/6 |
| 2026-08-17 | **Peak/off-peak** (peak 09:00-12:00 / 14:00-18:00 Beijing; off-peak = half) | see below |

Peak/off-peak prices (¥/1M):

| Model | Off-peak (cache-hit / miss / output) | Peak (cache-hit / miss / output) |
|---|---|---|
| deepseek-v4-flash | 0.05 / 1.5 / 4.5 | 0.10 / 3.0 / 9.0 |
| deepseek-v4-pro | 0.15 / 4.5 / 13.5 | 0.30 / 9.0 / 27.0 |

Semantics:

- **Priced by message time**: each message is billed with the policy and phase
  active at its completion time; new policies apply automatically.
- **Policy-chain inheritance**: a model not named by a newer policy keeps its
  last named price (historical bills stay consistent with the platform).
- **Self-healing**: when the schedule or config changes, the ledger is re-priced
  on restart using each record's stored token counts.
- **User overrides**: exact model entries in `prices` override the official
  table; `*` only fills models the official table never named.
  `officialPricing: off` uses only the user table.
- **Extensible**: append future official price changes via `policyOverrides`
  config — no code change needed (PRs to `lib/pricing.js` welcome).

> The schedule is curated from official announcements

## Install

The plugin is a standard DSH **bundle** (`dsh.bundle.patch` → its own
`cordis.patch.yml`), following the official
[packaging guide](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness/blob/master/docs/user/develop/basic/publish.md):

```powershell
# From GitHub
dsh plugin --profile web add github:<owner>/dsh-web-billing
# Or from npm (once published)
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-web-billing
# Or link a local checkout (no copy; edits take effect on restart)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/install.ps1 -Profile web
```

Restart `dsh web` afterwards. See `README.md` (Chinese) for the full config
reference, ledger semantics, and development notes. Run only one `dsh web`
instance per `$DSH_HOME`.

## Develop

```powershell
npm run check   # syntax checks
npm test        # pricing engine unit tests (node:test, zero deps)
```
